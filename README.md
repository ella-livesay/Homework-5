## Mapping and Graphing Homicide Data

### Colorado State University, ERHS 535 - Homework #5

This GitHub repository contains the completed ERHS 535: R Programming for Research Homework 5 assignment. 

The data folder contains raw homicide data from the Washington Post. This data can also be downloaded directly from the Washington Post [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv). The writing folder contains an R Markdown file with code relating to this assignment and the R Markdown PDF output. 

Note that this repository includes code for both choice 1---mapping solved and unsolved homicides in Denver, Colorado---and choice 2---recreating a graph of homicides by month in Baltimore, MD. The primary driver for this (other than coding curiosity) was to reach the minimum of 15 commits to this GitHub repository.
